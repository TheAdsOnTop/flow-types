# flow-types
A repository of updated Ads On Top flow types.

## Motivation

It is a pain to keep copying flow-types from one repository to another. The best solution is to share them at [flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed). However, that process is time consuming and requires writing tests on the flow types. Sometimes we want a quick typescript conversion available to everyone in the org.

A simple solution is to have a central versioned repository with all of our custom library definitions that gets pulled from a `yarn install`. That's what this repo is for

Eventually these types will be formailized and added to facebook's [flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed) repository.
